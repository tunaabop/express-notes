# Express Notes - Note Taker App

## Description

This is a simple, interactive note taker web app that uses Express.js in the backend to write, save, and delete notes. Note data is saved and retrieved in JSON form. The app is deployed in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) at [link](). 

## Walkthrough Video
This is a command line application, therefore will not be deployed. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-n10TWwoxJQDN6vsBuo5zbTT3dl_Fjdp/view) to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes written jest tests. 

The walkthrough video demonstrates how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application and invoke the application from the command line as well as how all tests are passed from the command line. It also shows the generated SVG file opened in the browser. The image in the browser should reflect the choices made by the user (text, shape, and colors).

## Screenshots

This is what the app should look like
